Spanning Tree=> when a graph can be converted to a tree and the tree doesnt have a cycle and every node can reach every other node, its called a spanning tree.
Graph had n nodes => tree has n nodes
Graph had e edges => tree must have n-1 edges

The above condition can be fulfilled in multiple ways. But we need the minimum totla cost of weights to get Minimum Spanning Tree.

To Find Min Spanning Tree.
Method 1. Prim's Algorithm.
